# Accelerating Compute-Intensive Workloads with AWS Batch and GPU Instances

*By AWS Solutions Architecture Team*

In today's data-driven world, organizations are processing increasingly large datasets that require significant computational power. Whether you're training machine learning models, processing images and videos, or running complex simulations, these workloads can be time-consuming and expensive when run on traditional CPU-based infrastructure. 

In this blog post, we'll explore how AWS Batch combined with GPU instances can dramatically accelerate compute-intensive workloads while optimizing costs. We'll share results from a real-world benchmark comparing GPU vs. CPU performance for common data processing tasks.

## The Challenge of Compute-Intensive Workloads

Many organizations face a common challenge: they need to process large datasets or run computationally intensive algorithms, but they don't need this processing power 24/7. Running dedicated instances continuously is expensive and inefficient, especially when workloads are intermittent or batch-oriented.

Some common examples include:
- Image and video processing pipelines
- Machine learning model training
- Scientific simulations
- Financial modeling and risk analysis
- Genomic sequencing and analysis

These workloads share common characteristics:
1. They're computationally intensive
2. They run periodically rather than continuously
3. They can benefit from parallel processing
4. They often have flexible timing requirements (not real-time)

## Enter AWS Batch with GPU Support

AWS Batch is a fully managed service that enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads on AWS. It dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources based on the volume and requirements of the batch jobs submitted.

When combined with GPU-enabled instances, AWS Batch becomes a powerful solution for accelerating compute-intensive workloads. Here's why:

1. **Pay only for what you use**: Resources are provisioned when jobs are submitted and terminated when jobs complete
2. **Automatic scaling**: AWS Batch automatically scales resources up or down based on workload
3. **GPU acceleration**: Access to NVIDIA GPUs for massively parallel processing
4. **No infrastructure management**: AWS handles the provisioning, scaling, and management of compute resources
5. **Cost optimization**: AWS Batch selects the most cost-effective instance types based on your requirements

## Benchmarking GPU vs. CPU Performance

To demonstrate the power of GPU acceleration with AWS Batch, we created a benchmark comparing GPU and CPU performance for common data processing tasks. Our benchmark included:

1. Matrix multiplication at different scales (1000x1000, 5000x5000, and 8000x8000)
2. Image processing operations on different image sizes (2048x2048 and 4096x4096) with batch sizes of 1 and 2
3. Gaussian blur filter application

### Benchmark Results

The results clearly demonstrate the advantage of GPU acceleration for these workloads:

| Operation | CPU Time (s) | GPU Time (s) | Speedup Factor |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Matrix 1000x1000 | 0.03 | 0.52 | 0.06 |
| Matrix 5000x5000 | 0.51 | 0.01 | 51.00 |
| Matrix 8000x8000 | 2.10 | 0.03 | 70.00 |
| Image 2048x2048 (batch 1) | 0.29 | 0.14 | 2.07 |
| Image 2048x2048 (batch 2) | 0.58 | 0.16 | 3.63 |
| Image 4096x4096 (batch 1) | 1.06 | 0.09 | 11.78 |
| Image 4096x4096 (batch 2) | 2.15 | 0.12 | 17.92 |
| Gaussian Blur | 0.09 | 0.05 | 1.80 |

> **Note**: For small matrices (1000x1000), the CPU actually outperforms the GPU. This is because the overhead of transferring data to the GPU exceeds the computational advantage for small workloads. This highlights the importance of choosing the right tool for the job based on workload characteristics.

### Key Observations

1. **Scale matters**: As the problem size increases, GPU advantage grows dramatically. For the 5000x5000 matrix multiplication, the GPU was 51x faster than the CPU, and for the 8000x8000 matrix, the advantage increased to 70x!

2. **Data transfer overhead**: For smaller workloads, the overhead of transferring data to the GPU can outweigh the computational advantage, as seen in the 1000x1000 matrix multiplication.

3. **Image processing advantage**: GPUs excel at image processing tasks, with speedups of 2-18x depending on image size and batch size. The advantage increases with both larger images and larger batch sizes.

## Cost Efficiency Analysis

Performance is only one part of the equation - cost efficiency is equally important. Let's look at the cost implications:

For the 8000x8000 matrix multiplication:
- CPU instance (r5.4xlarge): $1.01/hour
- GPU instance (g5.8xlarge): $2.88/hour

Despite the GPU instance being approximately 3x more expensive per hour, it completed the task 70x faster, resulting in a cost efficiency improvement of about 23x!

This means you're not only getting your results faster but also spending significantly less money on compute resources.

## Implementing GPU-Accelerated Batch Processing

Setting up GPU-accelerated batch processing with AWS Batch is straightforward:

1. **Create a compute environment**: Configure AWS Batch to use GPU-enabled instance types like p3, g4, or g5 instances.

2. **Define job queues**: Create job queues that target your GPU compute environment.

3. **Create job definitions**: Specify container images with CUDA support and configure resource requirements including GPU count.

4. **Submit jobs**: Submit jobs to the queue, and AWS Batch handles the rest - provisioning instances, running your workloads, and terminating instances when complete.

## Best Practices

Based on our experience, here are some best practices for GPU-accelerated batch processing:

1. **Right-size your workloads**: As our benchmark showed, small workloads may not benefit from GPU acceleration. Batch smaller tasks together when possible.

2. **Use appropriate container images**: Start with NVIDIA's CUDA base images and add your application dependencies.

3. **Monitor and optimize**: Use CloudWatch metrics to track job performance and resource utilization.

4. **Consider spot instances**: For non-time-critical workloads, spot instances can reduce costs by up to 90%.

5. **Optimize data transfer**: Minimize data movement between CPU and GPU memory, as this can be a significant bottleneck.

## Conclusion

AWS Batch combined with GPU instances offers a powerful solution for organizations with compute-intensive workloads. The ability to dynamically provision resources as needed means you only pay for what you use, while GPU acceleration delivers results faster and more cost-effectively than traditional CPU-based processing.

As our benchmarks demonstrate, the performance advantage of GPUs grows with the scale of the problem, making this approach particularly valuable for large-scale data processing tasks. By following the best practices outlined in this post, you can implement a cost-effective, high-performance batch processing solution for your organization's most demanding workloads.

Whether you're processing scientific data, training machine learning models, or rendering complex visualizations, AWS Batch with GPU support provides the performance you need without the overhead of managing infrastructure or paying for idle resources.
